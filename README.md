# NurallinkerDjango
Django based  cloud version of my 'Nurallinker app'

I would like to create a fork of this to be run on the user's machine and potentially 
one that does not depend on django since none of its advanced functions are in any way neccisary

Nurallinker is a simple webapp made by Joseph Pelletier, with the goal of helping create and 
strengthen neural pathways in your brain, in particular those pathways responsible for the mental
connection between sounds, images, and words. In other words, it can help you memorize some things. 
It supports image, audio, and text. You could use it for example, to learn musical notes, sounds 
and letters in a new language, or learn the names of objects.

This repo contains the django app directory
