<h1>About us</h1>
<p>
    Nurallinker is a simple webapp made by Joseph Pelletier, with the goal of helping create and strengthen neural pathways
    in your brain, in particular those pathways responsible for the mental connection between sounds, images, and words.
    In other words, it can help you memorize some things. It supports image, audio, and text.
    You could use it for example, to learn musical notes, sounds and letters in a new language,
    or learn the names of objects.
