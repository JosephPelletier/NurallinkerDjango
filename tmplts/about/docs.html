    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>
        The nav-bar is visible on every page except error responses.<br>
        It has 4 primary buttons:
        <ul>
            <li>'Browse' browse linkers by everyone on the platform. See <a href="#browse">browsing</a>.</li>
            <li>'Manage' manage your own linkers. See <a href="#management">management</a>.</li>

            <li>'Docs' read technical information about Nurallinker</li>
        </ul>
        If you are logged-in you will also see these buttons:
        <ul>
            <li>(Username) browse linkers made by you as another user would see them</li>
            <li>'Logout' which logs-you-out</li>

    <h2>Browsing</h2>
    <p>
        The Browse section lets you see all the linkers made by everyone on the platform. On each linker you will see
        its name, its author's name, and its description. By clicking a button on the liner you can start it or download
        it so you can modify and re-upload it as your own, but please do credit the uploader in
        the description of your upload. You may also click the name of the uploader of the linker to see everything
        they've uploaded.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="doc">
    <h2>Using a linker</h2>
    <p>
        Click the name of the linker or click the 'Start' button to start practicing.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be shown a question in the
        form of text image or sound, you will have to click the 'Play' button to hear the sound. If you have disabled
        javascript you will have to use your browser's built in audio controls, if you don't know that that means then you
        can safely ignore it.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will also be given a choice of a few answers, there can be 2 to 9 choices. The answer choices can be text,
        image, or sound; or the answer can be open ended, in this case you will have to recall the text answer from memory
        and enter it. To select an answer just click it, clicking the 'Play' button on an audio answer will not select it,
        but clicking anywhere else on an audio answer will select it. When an answer is selected the circle belonging to
        it will be filled. Once you are satisfied with your answer click the 'Check' button to check your answer, if you
        click the 'Check' button without selecting or entering an answer the question will be skipped and counted as wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then you click the 'Check' button you will be show the results page. You will see the following things in the following order.
        <ol>
            <li>The question you were asked</li>
            <li>The result; Correct, Incorrect, or Skipped</li>
            <li>The correct answer for the question you were asked</li>
        </ol>
        You will not be shown the answer you choose if it was wrong, that won't help you remember the right answer.
        From this page click next to be shown another question.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is not a set duration for a linker, the number of questions you are asked is a combination of how well
        you are doing, how many questions the linker has, and the randomness of what question you are asked. See
        <a class="mono" href="#question-generation">Question generation</a> and <a href="#mastery">Mastery</a>
        for more on this.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may user more than one linker at once and even close them without losing your progress, but there is no
        guarantee your progress will be saved day to day (this may change in the future, probably when we add a progress
        measure to the check page)
    </p>
</div>
<div class="doc" id="question-generation">
    <h2 class="mono">Question generation</h2>
    <p class="mono">
        Questions are generated with the help of sudo-random numbers, firstly a bit is generated, based on this bit the
        question generator either selects the question or the correct answer. Each possible question, and each possible
        answer has an integer weight called its 'odds'. The odds control how likely a particular question or answer is
        to be selected, if question 'A' has odds 1 and question 'B' has odds 3, question 'B' is three times more likely
        to be selected than question 'A'. The same is true if it were answer 'A' and 'B' instead of question 'A' and 'B'
    </p>
    <p class="mono">
        When a question is answered correctly the odds number of the asked question and the correct answer are decreased
        by one, likewise when a question is answered incorrectly or is skipped the odds number of the asked question and
        the correct answer are increased by one; this increases the chance that it will be seen again as a question, and
        the chance it will again be the correct answer. The odds number starts at 2 and is not aloud to fall bellow 1.
        When the odds humber on every question and every answer is 1 the the linker is mastered. See <a href="#mastery">Mastery</a>
        for more info on mastery.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="doc" id="mastery">
    <h2>Mastery</h2>
    <p>
        When it seems that you are reliably getting every question right you will see a page telling you that you have
        mastered the linker, at this point you probably don't need to study any more for now, but you may continue by
        clicking the name of the linker or by clicking the word 'here'. When you see this page you progress on the
        linker will be reset so that you can use it again without being shown the mastery page immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        For technical information on when exactly mastery occurs see

    <h2>Loging-in</h2>
    <p>
        To get to the <a href="/login">login page</a> click 'Manage' on the nav-bar while logged-out.
        To log-in or create an account enter a username and password then click the 'Login' button.
        Usernames may not begin with a dot or contain a forward slash. If the account name is available to be created
        you will be prompted to confirm the password for the new account and
        if the passwords match you will be logged-into the newly created account.
    </p>
    <p class="mono">
        The login page is made to be error tolerant, if the user types an invalid username or incorrect password an
        error message will appear above the problematic field.
    </p>
    <p class="mono">
        Passwords are not stored, what is stored is the sha256 digest of the concatenation of the username with a
        forward slash with the password `sha256(uname .. '/' .. passwd)`. Since the forward slash is not aloud in
        usernames this authentication string is guaranteed to me unique and thus it is astronomically unlikely that two
        authentication hashes are the same. This makes these passwords useless to an attacker who has stolen them from
        the server to the extent to which they are too strong to be brute forced. Since all auth strings are unique no
        matching password attack can be preformed to identify passwords. The system maintains that brute force is the
        only possible attack. Many site designers skip over good security and store your passwords in one form or
        another in order to authenticate you. When you log-in to this site your auth-string is produced, hashed, and
        immediately discarded, if the hash matches the one stored on the server, then you, beyond any reasonable doubt
        know your password, and so, you are aloud to log-in.

<div class="doc" id="management">
    <h2>Management</h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="/manage">manage page</a> can be accessed by clicking the 'Manage' button on the nav-bar.
        Here you will see a list of linkers you've uploaded and at the top of the page there is a field where you can enter
        the name of a new linker, upon clicking create you will be directed to the <a href="#update">update page</a> for
        this linker where you can upload it.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each linker you've uploaded there are three buttons
         <ol>
            <li>Update; allows you to re-upload</li>
            <li>Download; allows you to download your linker for modification</li>
            <li>Delete; removes your linker from the site</li>
        </ol>
        You may also click the linker name to start using it.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="doc" id="update">
    <h2>Update</h2>
    <p>
        The update page allows you to upload or re-upload your linker as a zip file, it is accessed from the
        <a href="/manage">manage page</a> via the create button or via the
        'Update' button on one of your existing linkers

    <p>
        When you upload your linker you agree to <a href="#licence">the licence</a> or affirm that your work comes from
        this site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you upload your linker you should check that it meets <a href="#requirements">the requirements</a>,
        because fixing one error at a time using the error messages has the potential to be quite painful for you,
        we don't recommend it.

    <p>
        If you fail to meet a <a href="#requirements">requirement</a> you will see an error above the file choose button.

    <h2>Linker Settings</h2>
    <p>
        The linker settings allow you to customise your linkers description, what types of questions and answers are
        enabled or disabled, and how many multiple choice options will be given for a given answer type.
    </p>
    <p>
        nurallinker will ignore lines starting with '#', these lines are called comments.
        if you add any lines they have to start with '#'
        the rows that control the settings do not start with '#'
    </p>
    <p>
        the settings are organized as a grid, the rows are q (question), a (answer), c (choose)
        and the columns are i (image), a (audio), t (text), o (open)
    </p>
    <ul>
        for settings that are switches + is enabled, - is disabled
        <li>row q is for question switches, it controls what question types are enabled, + is enabled, - is disabled, there are 3 question switches: i, a, t</li>
        <li>row a is for answer switches, it controls what question types are enabled, there are 4 answer switches: i, a, t, o</li>
        <li>row c is for choose numbers, instead of a + or - for on or off you place a single digit from 2 to 9, that will be the
        number of choices given for the corresponding answer type. If the type is disabled place a 0 or - in place of the digit for readability</li>
        <li>column i is for the image question/answer type</li>
        <li>column a is for the audio question/answer type</li>
        <li>column t is for the text question/answer type</li>
        <li>column o is for the open-ended question/answer type, open ended is a text answer but the user types it, no
        choices are given.</li>
        <li>row d holds the decription of the linker as it shows up on the browse page.</li>

    <h2>Identifiers</h2>

        Identifiers map questions to answers and vice versa. The part of the file name before the first dot is the
        identifier. For example, 'dog.sitting.png' would match with 'dog.txt' and 'dog.barking.mp3' because they all
        have the identifier 'dog'.
